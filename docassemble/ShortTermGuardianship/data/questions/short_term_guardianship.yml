  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Short-term guardianship** Easy Form.

  This program helps you prepare a form to appoint a short-term guardian to take care of your child for up to 1 year. The short-term guardianship can take effect now or at a later time, such as in an emergency.
  
  The form you create can only be used in Illinois.

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
  
  To complete this program, you will need to know: 
  
  * The names and addresses of two people who will witness you sign the guardianship form, and
  * The name and address of the person being appointed as the short-term guardian.

  After you download your form, you will need to sign and date it in front of 2 witnesses. If another parent or guardian also has custody, they may need to sign the form as well.

question: |
  Short-term guardian
subquestion: |
  A short-term guardian is someone who is responsible for a child for one year or less. A short-term guardian has temporary authority to make medical, educational, and personal decisions for a child. They can not apply for a passport for the child, obtain food stamps for the child, or add the child to their insurance.
  
  ${ collapse_template(passport_etc) }
  
  Only a parent or guardian can pick a short-term guardian. The parent or guardian does not need to go to court, but the agreement must be in writing. 
  
  You can create a short-term guardianship for a child that is not born yet.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**getting guardianship of a child**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/getting-guardianship-child-0).

template: passport_etc
subject: |
  **What if I need a guardian who can apply for a passport for my child, obtain food stamps for my child, or add my child to their insurance?**
content: |
  A court-ordered plenary guardian can do those things. Short-term guardianships are intended to be temporary. If your child needs a guardian for more than a year, you may want to speak to a lawyer about a plenary guardianship.

  * The other ${parent_or_guardian} is not willing or able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the child,
  * The parents were never married, the other ${parent_or_guardian} is not on the child's birth certificate, and no court has issued an order establishing parentage, or
  * The other ${parent_or_guardian}'s wherabouts are unknown.
  
  However, if the situation changes, the other ${parent_or_guardian} may be able to end the short-term guardianship.

  Short-term guardianship cannot be used to avoid the custody rights of another parent. Use this program only if you have custody or authority over your child. If contacting the other parent would be dangerous, do not use this program.

  Guardianship order
subquestion: |
  Since you are ${child.name.full(middle='full')}'s guardian, you may want to include a copy of the order that gave you guardianship with the short-term guardianship appointment. This will help prove that you have the authority to appoint a short-term guardian.
  
  If you have an active court case involving the child, you may want to tell the judge that you are appointing a short-term guardian.
