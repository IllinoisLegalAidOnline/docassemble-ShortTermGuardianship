  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Short term guardian appointment** Easy Form.

  This program helps you prepare forms to appoint a short term guardian to be responsible your child for up to 1 year.
  
  The form you create can only be used in Illinois.

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
  
  To complete this program, you will need to know: 
  
  * The names and addresses of two people who will witness you sign the guardianship form, and
  * The name and address of the person being appointed as the short term guardian.

  After you download your form, you will need to sign and date it in front of 2 witnesses. If another parent or guardian also has custody, they may need to sign the form as well.
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0DCAF0" ) } that also gives help.
